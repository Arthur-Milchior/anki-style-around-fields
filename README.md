# CSS style around fields
## Rationale
I'd love to be able to have css applied to the content of fields. This
add-on modify card's type to ensure that it is the case. I may also
want to remove those fields because this impair readability. So this
add-on also also allow to remove those CSS style.

## Usage
In the browser, select at least a note of each type you want to
modify. Do "Edit>Style around fields" to add the CSS fields, and
"Edit>Remove style around style" to remove them.

## TODO
It would be nice to edit the card type directly from the card type
editor. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to add button there.
